A creature affected by this tether regains 2d10 hit points when it's first affected by it, and while it's connected to the tether, it deals an extra 1d10 damage of the weapon's type to the first target it hits with a melee weapon attack on each of its turns. In addition, on each of your following turns while you maintain the tether, you can expend 1 of the rod's charges as a bonus action to send a surge of healing magic through the tether and cause the target to regain 2d10 hit points.</p> <p><strong>Withering Tether.</strong> This tether is a sickly red. A creature affected by this tether must make a Constitution saving throw when it's first affected by it, using your spell save DC. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d10 necrotic damage, and on each of your following turns while you maintain the tether, you can use a bonus action to deal 1d10 necrotic damage to the target automatically. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much necrotic damage, and the tether immediately ends.</p> <p>The tether and its effect ends after 1 minute. It ends early if you sever the tether (no action required), are no longer holding the rod, the target ends its turn more than 30 feet away from you, the target has total cover from you, or if you or the target fall unconscious.</p>",

        "description": "<p>These boots look and feel like pale, dried leaves but are remarkably soft and quiet to walk in. While wearing these boots, you can move normally in difficult terrain caused by strong winds.</p> <p>While wearing these boots, you can use an action to speak their command word to cast the gaseous form spell, transforming yourself into a swirling cloud of vapor and leaves. This version of the spell lasts for up to 1 minute, but only allows you to float vertically using your movement speed. Your horizontal movement speed while in this form is decided by the direction and speed of the wind. A wind of light speed (between 5 and 10 miles per hour) propels you 10 feet per round, whereas a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) pushes you 20 feet instead.</p> <p>Traveling somewhere while in this form where the swirling leaves are unable to follow you ends the effect early. Once the boots have been used to cast this spell, they can't do so again until the next dawn.</p>",
